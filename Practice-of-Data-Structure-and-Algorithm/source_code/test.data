4006#$#The Project  WDT Driver for LPC1114 on FreeRTOS  was my Project work required for the partial Completion of my Post Graduate Diploma in Embedded System Design at Center for Development of Advanced Computing, Advanced Computing Training School, Pune, India.The Duration of the Project was 15-20 Days wherein we had to develop the driver library for the Watchdog Timer on LPC1114 and incorporate the same into FreeRTOS.The services of the driver are exported using the UNIX like read, write, Open and ioctl system calls used by the various tasks in the FreeRTOS environment to register with the Watchdog service. The Watchdog service itself is a task running as an idle task hook and services the watchdog on behalf of all the tasks that are registered with our driver.The driver would reset the system if any of the registered tasks do not perform as they should.This is a student Project, a team of 5, There are some corner cases here and there which would be eliminated gradually.

The general idea is to try and get the things that computers are good at correct: character conversion, graphic conversion, etc.  Page layout suffers because control in RTF is pretty pathetic compared to TeX.  Consequently, it is likely that manual reformatting will be needed.Translation of bibliographies is pretty good and a wide range of styles are handled, but you must typeset your LaTeX file to create the needed .aux and .bbl files first.Translation of equations used to be excellent: it used to be possible to double-click equations in Word and then edit with MathType.  Unfortunately, this conversion in Word has gotten progressively worse over the years (I changed nothing!).

4210#$#MED-FOES is an implementation of a stochastic Agent-Based Simulation (ABS) system for analyzing demographic changes in a single population of Medfly (Ceratitis capitata) over time. The simulation currently takes population extinction as a given because it aims to give us better estimates of necessary quarantine lengths in areas where Medfly is not currently established but does repeatedly invade. Thus the objective of this software is to estimate the time to local extirpation based on known ranges of developmental, survivorship and reproductive parameters, as well as assumed ranges of an eradication pressure parameter. For a complete analysis and estimate of time to extirpation one would execute a large number of individual simulations evenly distributed over parameter space to estimate the time at which an arbitrary percentage of the simulations show extirpation.
