What Acrylic does is to reduce the time dedicated to name resolution for frequently visited addresses as close to zero as possible.With Acrylic you can also gracefully overcome short downtimes of your DNS servers without disrupting your work, because in this case you will at least be able to connect to your favourite sites and to your email server. In addition Acrylic can help you to effectively block unwanted ads prior to their download through the use of a custom HOSTS files, optimizing your navigation experience even further.#$#Communications,Name Service (DNS),Networking,

A mangrove is a plugin to load in the system.- efficiency: choose the most suitable representation wrt application needs, which satisfy high efficiency in time for topological queries, small storage cost, and high expressive power.- easy-to-use: a simple interface, which wraps complex and internal structure, and hides internal details. It requires a small learning curve.It also provides an implicit representation of simplices, not directly encoded in a data structure, which we call ghost simplices.#$#Algorithms,Libraries,Object Oriented,

629#$#This tool will allow for videoconference sessions with up to 6 people, using audio or video. The main idea is to make it easy for students to set up a session without the intervention of the teacher and to record and archive the recording without the need of installing additional software. There are two interfaces: the recorder and the player. The recorder should distinguish itself from already existent videoconferencing systems by its ease of use, recording and archiving which should be its main features. The player s most distinctive functionality is the solo/mute buttons which allow teachers to listen to the group or to a specific learner in isolation. There will be no moderator or administrator roles, all participants will have the same profile and it will be designed specifically for language students carrying out synchronous tasks.#$#Chat,Languages,Web Conferencing,

Given that the controller can accept data from over the network, another embedded controller that is able to use these kinds of cameras can be loaded with this software to send the image and depth data from the 3D camera over the network to the other controller.Currently, KinectStreamer can only use the libfreenect library as its driver.

Low footprint: compact script - 2.25KB (requires jquery-minimal 1.5+)2. Ease of use: link the script to your html and add an empty <p id= feedPanel  rssurl= <feed url>  feedcount= <number of items you want to display> > tag.3. Fully customisable: YMMV depending on your HTML skills (basic is enough). :)4. Optimised execution with  wait  indicator.5.

The visual block diagram interface offers a simple method for constructing, modifying and maintaining complex system models. The simulation engine provides fast and accurate solutions for linear, nonlinear, continuous time, discrete time, time varying and hybrid system designs. With JMCAD, users can quickly develop software or  virtual  prototypes of systems or processes to demonstrate their behavior prior to building physical prototypes.The user builds his system model by selecting predefined blocks from a block library and simply wiring the blocks together. Each block of the diagram performs a function. Users can also create custom blocks in Java and add them to the JMCAD block library.JMCAD is a block diagram language for creating complex nonlinear dynamic systems.#$#Computer Aided Instruction (CAI),Electronic Design Automation (EDA),Human Machine Interfaces,Mathematics,Simulations,Testing,

The results of a job run are saved to an archive file. Subsequent runs of the job are compared to this archive to determine which files have changed. New, deleted, renamed or moved files are also reported. The results view may be sorted, filtered and searched.  Results may be exported in csv format or to another installation of DeepDigest.

Multispectral imaging has been gaining popularity and has been gradually applied to many fields besides remote sensing. However, due to the high dimensionality of the data, both human observers and computers have difficulty interpreting this wealth of information. Gerbil facilitates the visualization of the relationship between spectral and topological information in a novel fashion. It puts emphasis on the spectral gradient, which is shown to provide enhanced information for many reflectance analysis tasks. It also includes a rich toolbox for evaluation of image segmentation and other algorithms in the multispectral domain. The parallel coordinates visualization technique is combined with hashing for a highly interactive visual connection between spectral distribution, spectral gradient, and topology.#$#Astronomy,Viewers,Visualization,

Capsule-oriented programming is designed to address the challenges of concurrent programming. A central goal of this programming style is to provide tools to enable programmers to simply do what they do best, that is, to describe a system in terms of its modular structure and write sequential code to implement the operations of those modules. Capsule-oriented programs are implicitly concurrent. There are no explicit threads or synchronization locks; if necessary or beneficial, concurrency is introduced by the compiler. Capsule-oriented programming eliminates two classes of concurrency errors: sequential inconsistency and race conditions due to shared data.

It will often recover formatting as well as text. Also of possible interest is Excel Recovery Stand Alone or Add-In versions for xlsx files, again available on Sourceforge. The last two invoke Microsoft methods as well as the method used by Corrupt Office 2007-2013 Extractor.Corrupt Office 2007-2013 Extractor will extract the text/data from corrupt docx, xlsx, and pptx files where the respective MS Office files error out and refuses to open. In advanced mode the program can fix the zip structure of these new  Office Open  format files, a step which I now recommend despite our dissuasive blurb which comes up when you start that function. Advanced mode also allows recovering images and if you are familiar with XML, includes is a basic XML editor for editing corrupt XML which might be causing the docx, xlsx or pptx corruption.#$#Data recovery,Spreadsheet,Word Processors,

NAND is Turing Complete because all digital technology can be described as combinations of NANDs. A node that represents the statement that 2 nodes are perpendicular is a NAND because other nodes can be parallel to one, the other, but not both. This is a new branch of math that most naturally represents the Max Clique view of the P vs NP math problem (and its million dollar millenium prize for proving P equals or does not equal NP) this way: Node pairs without edges have a dot products of 0, and with edges its 1. A dot product of -1 means parallel and opposite directions. By using spring-like forces (in specific softwares using FuzzyNAND) the Max Clique math problem can be represented in a possibly hill climbable way. This is a minimalist language where statements can refer to eachother in terms of dot product. Its similar to Fast Fourier Transform as a Base Pi math system.#$#Artificial Intelligence,Quantum Computing,Statistics,

Currently, when training corpus, compared with CRF++, CRF# can make full use of multi-core CPUs and only uses very low memory, and memory grow is very smoothly and slowly while amount of training corpus, tags increase. with multi-threads process, CRF# is more suitable for large data and tags training than CRF++ now.

What we think our eyes see, the imagination, is the densest and smallest layer.

The best way to use SpurTracer is by adding punctual tracing to components in your infrastructure on-demand.#$#Debuggers,Monitoring,Systems Administration,
